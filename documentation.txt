What dataset are you using?
Pokemon dataset

What went right in the development of this project?
Everything seems to work as expected!

What went wrong in the development of this project?
Nothing really went wrong, but I did not implement as much as I wanted to. (I did not format the data nicely). Also, when you search for a pokemon, you  must type it with the first letter capitalized, otherwise it won't find it in the dataset.

What did you learn while developing this project?
I learned more about using node.js and got more proficient in writing code following the request/response process. Initially, the amount of files (server, client, all the response files) intimidated me and I would get lost, but I started to understand the purpose of each of them and was able to easily find the code snippets I was looking for after a while.

If you went above and beyond, how did you do so?
I made the style of the page fit the theme of a pokedex!

If you used any borrowed code or code fragments, where did you get them from?
What do the code fragments do? Where are they in your code?
Other than code used in previous assignments, I did not borrow code fragments.
